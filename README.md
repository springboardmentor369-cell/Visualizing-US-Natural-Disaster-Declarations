Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations (FEMA Data)

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes natural disaster declarations in the United States using FEMA data. Interactive dashboards and KPIs help stakeholders understand disaster patterns, frequency, and impact, enabling better emergency preparedness and decision-making.

⚠️ Problem Statement

Natural disasters significantly affect communities and economies in the U.S., but tracking patterns and trends across states and disaster types is challenging due to the complexity of FEMA data. This project addresses the need for:

Quick visualization of disaster trends

Identifying most affected states and disaster types

Tracking tribal assistance requests and disaster impact

📊 Dataset Description

The FEMA dataset contains historical and recent disaster declarations with key fields:

Column	Description
Disaster Number	Unique ID for each disaster declaration
Incident Type	Type of disaster (Flood, Hurricane, Tornado, etc.)
State	U.S. state where the disaster occurred
Declaration Date	Date when the disaster was declared
Incident Begin/End Date	Duration of the disaster
Cost & Impact	Estimated damage cost, people affected
Assistance Requests	Requests for federal aid, including tribal communities

Source: FEMA Open Data

📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Disasters by Year – Annual count of declarations

Disasters by Type – Most frequent disaster types

People Affected – Impact per disaster type/year

Cost of Disasters – Financial impact per disaster type/year

State-wise Disaster Frequency – Most disaster-prone states

Tribal Assistance Requests – Count and type per disaster

🔍 Key Insights

California, Texas, and Florida have the highest disaster frequency.

Floods and hurricanes are the most common; tornadoes and wildfires have high localized impact.

Hurricanes cause the highest financial damage.

Tribal assistance requests highlight the need for tailored emergency planning.

💡 Recommendations (Future Improvements)

Integrate real-time FEMA data for live dashboards.

Predict disasters using machine learning based on historical trends.

Include geographic maps for county- and state-level analysis.

Combine socio-economic data to assess disaster vulnerability and aid allocation efficiency.
