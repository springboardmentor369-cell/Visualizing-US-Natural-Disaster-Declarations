**Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations Using FEMA Data**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing natural disaster declarations in the United States using FEMA data. Interactive dashboards and key performance indicators are developed to help stakeholders understand disaster trends, frequency, and impact. The goal is to support better emergency preparedness and informed decision-making.

**Problem Statement**

Natural disasters have a significant impact on communities and the economy in the United States. However, identifying patterns and trends across different states and disaster types is difficult due to the complexity and size of FEMA data. This project aims to address the need for:

Clear visualization of disaster trends
Identification of the most affected states and disaster types
Tracking of tribal assistance requests and overall disaster impact

**Dataset Description**

The FEMA dataset includes historical and recent disaster declarations with the following key fields:

Disaster Number – Unique identifier for each disaster declaration
Incident Type – Type of disaster such as flood, hurricane, or tornado
State – US state where the disaster occurred
Declaration Date – Date when the disaster was officially declared
Incident Begin Date and End Date – Duration of the disaster
Cost and Impact – Estimated financial damage and number of people affected
Assistance Requests – Requests for federal aid, including tribal communities

Source: FEMA Open Data

**Key Performance Indicators**

Total Disasters by Year – Annual count of disaster declarations
Disasters by Type – Most frequently occurring disaster types
People Affected – Impact measured per disaster type and year
Cost of Disasters – Financial impact categorized by disaster type and year
State-wise Disaster Frequency – States with the highest number of disasters
Tribal Assistance Requests – Number and type of requests per disaster

**Key Insights**

California, Texas, and Florida record the highest number of disaster declarations.
Floods and hurricanes are the most frequent disaster types, while tornadoes and wildfires create significant localized impact.
Hurricanes result in the highest financial losses.
Tribal assistance requests indicate the importance of specialized emergency planning for tribal communities.

**Recommendations and Future Improvements**

Integrate real-time FEMA data to enable live dashboard updates.
Develop predictive models using machine learning based on historical disaster trends.
Incorporate geographic maps for state-level and county-level analysis.
Combine socio-economic data to better assess vulnerability and improve aid allocation strategies.

**Tools Used**

Power BI for interactive dashboards and KPI visualization
Python with Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and transformation
Excel and CSV for dataset management
DAX for custom KPI calculations
