🌍 US Natural Disaster Analytics Dashboard (Power BI Project)
📊 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analysing historical natural disaster data across the United States (1953–2024).
The objective of this project is to transform raw disaster data into meaningful insights that can support government planning, disaster preparedness, and resource allocation.

The dashboard focuses on identifying high-risk regions, most frequent disaster types, financial impact, and long-term disaster trends to support data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyse historical disaster patterns across US states

Identify high-risk states and the most common disaster types

Understand yearly and monthly disaster trends

Evaluate financial assistance and damage impact

Provide insights useful for government disaster planning and resource allocation

Build a corporate-level interactive dashboard using Power BI

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI – Data visualisation and dashboard creation

Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing

Python (Jupyter Notebook) – Data cleaning & analysis (initial stages)

GitHub – Version control and project documentation

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes historical disaster records with attributes such as:

Disaster type

State and region

Fiscal year and month

Public assistance and financial impact

Individual and housing assistance

Incident type and declaration details

The data was cleaned, transformed, and modelled before visualisation.

📈 Dashboard Features
🔹 Executive Dashboard

Total disasters recorded

Most affected state

Most common disaster type

Yearly disaster trend (1953–2024)

State-wise disaster distribution

Disaster type distribution

Monthly disaster pattern

Interactive slicers for filtering by disaster type

🔹 Advanced Insights Dashboard

Public assistance by disaster type

Individual & housing assistance impact

States receiving the highest disaster assistance

Yearly trend of disasters

Financial and impact analysis

Interactive filtering for deep analysis

💡 Key Insights

Certain states, like California and Texas, show consistently high disaster frequency

Fire and severe storms are among the most common disaster types

Disaster occurrences have increased significantly since 2000

Peak disaster months fall between mid-year and early winter

Financial assistance is concentrated in high-risk states and disaster types

These insights can help government agencies improve:

Disaster preparedness

Budget allocation

Emergency response planning

Infrastructure and early warning systems

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed unnecessary and null fields

Standardised inconsistent text values

Handled missing values appropriately

Created calculated columns and measures

Structured data model with proper relationships

Ensured a clean and analysis-ready dataset

🎨 Dashboard Design Approach

Corporate-level color theme and layout

Clean and minimalistic visualization

Focus on readability and decision-making insights

Interactive and user-friendly design

Proper visual hierarchy and alignment

🚀 How to Use the Dashboard

Open Power BI dashboard file (.pbix)
