## 📘 Learning Journey as a Beginner
As a beginner in data analytics, this project represents my first structured hands-on experience with data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Working with tools like Power BI, Power Query, Python, APIs, and live data sources was initially challenging, especially dealing with unfamilia words and tools ,handling large raw data, managing missing values and correcting data types

Over four weeks, I progressed through each stage of the data analytics lifecycle—from basic data cleaning to exploratory data analysis and finally working with APIs and data pipelines. This documentation captures both what I learned and how my confidence grew while applying industry-relevant tools to a real-world dataset.

* Improved proficiency in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies
* Understood how APIs function, including making requests, handling responses, and transforming JSON data
* Built foundational knowledge of data pipelines and automated data workflows
* Learned the difference between static, live, dummy, and synthetic data, and when each is appropriate
* Gained exposure to web scraping techniques when APIs are unavailable
* Developed an understanding of customer support data through tools like Zendesk.
* Improved problem-solving skills through debugging, data validation, and iterative improvements
* Strengthened confidence in using industry-relevant tools and technologies
### 🛠 Tools Used Throughout the Project

* Handled missing values (replaced "Unknown" with null).
* Designed Star Schema model:
   * Created Fact Table (Global_Landslide_Catalog).
   * Created Dimension tables (Country, Date, Category, etc.).
   * Established One-to-Many relationships.
   * Understood why Many-to-Many relationships cause ambiguity.

#### 🧠 Key Learning:
* Importance of Star Schema for performance and scalability.
* Difference between Fact and Dimension tables.
* How filter context flows in relationships.
* Why numeric columns must not contain text values.
### 📅 Week 6 :DAX Measures & Composite Measures
