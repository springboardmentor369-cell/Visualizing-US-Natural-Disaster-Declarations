# Week 1: Data Cleaning and Transformation using Power Query
Week 1 marked my first hands-on experience with the data analytics lifecycle. This week emphasized the importance of **data cleaning and transformation** as a foundational step before any meaningful analysis. Through practical exercises, I learned that real-world data is often messy, inconsistent, and incomplete, making preprocessing an essential part of data analytics.
## Introduction to Power Query
Power Query is a powerful data preparation tool in **Power BI** used for cleaning, transforming, and shaping data. During this week, I learned that Power Query follows the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process:
* **Extract** – Importing data from multiple sources such as Excel and CSV files
* **Transform** – Cleaning, modifying, and structuring the data
* **Load** – Loading the refined data into Power BI for analysis and visualization
One key advantage of Power Query is that it allows complex transformations **without writing code**, making it beginner-friendly while remaining highly efficient and scalable.

## Importing and Exploring the Dataset
I learned how to import datasets into Power Query and perform an initial data assessment using the **Power Query Editor**. The dataset provided by our mentor was a **Customer Call List**, which contained real-world inconsistencies.
Initial exploration involved:
* Verifying column names and structure
* Identifying incorrect or inconsistent data types
* Detecting missing, null, or blank values
* Understanding the meaning and relevance of each column
This step helped in planning the appropriate cleaning and transformation actions.

## Data Cleaning Activities Performed
To standardize and improve data quality, I performed several data cleaning operations:
## Removing Unnecessary Columns
I identified columns that were irrelevant for analysis and removed them to reduce complexity and improve efficiency.
## Handling Missing Values
I addressed missing and null values by either replacing them with suitable defaults or removing incomplete records, depending on the context, to prevent inaccurate results.
## Removing Duplicate Records
Duplicate entries were identified and removed to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
## Renaming Columns
Columns were renamed using clear and meaningful labels to improve readability and simplify reporting.
## Correcting Data Types
### I converted columns to appropriate data types (such as text to numeric and fixing date formats), which is critical for accurate calculations and visualizations.

## Data Transformation Techniques Learned
Beyond cleaning, I applied transformation techniques to enhance data usability and visualization.
## Splitting and Merging Columns
I split columns containing combined information (e.g., full names or dates) and merged related columns when required to improve data organization.
## Filtering and Sorting Data
Filtering irrelevant records and sorting data helped focus on meaningful insights and identify patterns more efficiently.
## Creating Custom Columns
### Using simple formulas, I created custom columns to derive new insights from existing data while preserving the original dataset.

## Key Learnings
* Real-world data is rarely clean and requires thorough preprocessing before analysis
* Data cleaning and transformation directly impact the accuracy of insights and decision-making
* Power Query is an efficient tool for handling missing values, errors, and inconsistencies
* Correct data types are essential for reliable calculations and analytics
* **Applied Steps** in Power Query help track transformations and enable automatic updates during data refresh
