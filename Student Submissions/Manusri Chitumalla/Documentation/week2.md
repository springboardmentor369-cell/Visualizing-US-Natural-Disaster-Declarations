# Week 2: Data Cleaning using Python
In The Week 2  we are introduced to data cleaning using Python. Unlike Power Query’s visual, no-code interface, Python required writing code, understanding syntax, and applying logical thinking. Although it felt difficult initially, this week helped me realize how powerful, flexible, and scalable Python is for handling real-world data.

## Working with Python Environment
At the start of the week, I learned how to install and configure Python on my system. I was introduced to VS Code as the development environment and Jupyter Notebook for writing and executing Python code interactively.
Using Jupyter Notebook was a new experience for me. I learned that each cell runs independently, allowing step-by-step execution and immediate output visualization. Initially, tasks such as installing libraries and running basic code were confusing, but continuous practice helped me gain confidence.
## Introduction to the Pandas Library
One of the most important learnings of this week was the Pandas library, which is widely used for data manipulation and analysis in Python. I learned how to:
 * Import Pandas and load datasets using pd.read_csv( )
 * Understand DataFrames and Series
 * Work with data organized in rows and columns, similar to Excel but far more powerful
Although reading and understanding data structures felt difficult at first, repeated practice helped me understand how efficiently Pandas handles large datasets.

## Data Cleaning Techniques Learned in Python
### Removing Duplicate Records:
I learned how duplicate records can negatively impact analysis and practiced removing duplicate rows using Pandas functions, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
### Handling Missing (NaN) and Null Values.
### Understanding missing values was a key learning.
### Identify NaN and null values.
### Replace missing values with appropriate substitutes.
### Remove rows or columns where missing data affected reliability:
This process helped improve the overall quality of the dataset.
### Replacing Incorrect or Inconsistent Values:
I worked on identifying and replacing incorrect values such as special characters (/) and inconsistent entries. This step helped standardize the data and improve uniformity.
### Splitting Columns:
I learned how to split a single column into multiple columns using Python string functions. This was especially useful when columns contained combined information that needed to be separated for better analysis.
### Dropping Unnecessary Columns
Similar to Power Query, I learned how to remove irrelevant columns in Python, which helped keep the dataset focused and easier to analyze.

## Key Learnings:
* Python provides greater flexibility and control over data cleaning tasks.
* Pandas is a powerful and efficient library for data manipulation.
* Writing code improves logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
* Hands-on practice is essential to understanding programming concepts.
