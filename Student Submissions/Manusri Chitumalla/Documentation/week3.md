# Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Week 3 focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which helped me understand how to study and interpret data before jumping into conclusions or building visualizations. This week changed the way I approach data. Instead of only cleaning it, I learned how to ask meaningful questions, identify patterns, and uncover the story hidden within the dataset. EDA helped me realize that data analysis is not just a technical task but also requires strong business understanding and critical thinking.
##What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of examining a dataset to understand its structure, trends, patterns, and relationships. The primary objective of EDA is to become familiar with the data and generate insights before applying advanced analytics or creating dashboards.
Through EDA, I learned that it helps in:
* Understanding what the data represents
* Identifying errors, inconsistencies, or unusual values
* Discovering trends and patterns
* Framing the right business-oriented questions
* Supporting data-driven decision-making

## Steps of EDA Learned
### 1. Checking Data Volume and Structure
The first step in EDA was understanding the size and structure of the dataset. This included:
* Checking the number of rows and columns
* Identifying relevant and irrelevant fields
* Understanding how large or complex the dataset is
This step helped me decide which data points are important from a business perspective and which can be excluded from analysis.
### 2. Understanding Data Distribution and Identifying Outliers
I learned how to analyze data distribution to understand how values are spread across the dataset. This helped in identifying:
* Common value ranges
* Skewed data
* Extreme values or outliers
* Outliers can sometimes indicate data errors or rare but important cases, so identifying them is essential for accurate and meaningful analysis.
### 3. Comparing Metrics Across Categories
Another important learning was comparing metrics across different categories. This helped in:
* Evaluating performance across groups
* Identifying high-performing and low-performing segments
* Understanding variations and trends
This step showed how comparisons play a key role in performance analysis and decision-making.
### 4. Identifying Relationships Between Variables
I learned how to explore relationships between variables to understand how one factor influences another. For example:
* How changes in price affect sales
* How content type influences viewer ratings
* This step helped me understand cause-and-effect relationships and how data supports strategic business decisions.
  
### Practical Application: Netflix Dataset Analysis
To apply EDA concepts practically, we worked on a Netflix dataset provided by our mentor. Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned and standardized. After cleaning, we were asked to identify five meaningful business questions that could be answered using the data.
This activity helped me:
* Think beyond raw numbers and focus on insights
*Translate data into business-relevant conclusions
*Understand how organizations use data to guide decisions
*Learning from a Business Perspective
Week 3 helped me shift from a purely technical approach to a business-oriented analytical mindset. I learned that EDA is not about finding random patterns but about uncovering insights that add value to the business.

### EDA helped me understand:
* What questions stakeholders care about
* How data supports strategic planning
* Why interpretation is as important as analysis

## Key Learnings from Week 3
* EDA is essential before advanced analysis or visualization
* Understanding data structure improves analysis accuracy
* Asking the right questions is as important as technical skills
* Patterns and relationships guide business decisions
* Effective data analysis requires both technical expertise and business thinking
