# Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations
## 1. Problem Statement :
Natural disasters significantly impact lives, infrastructure, and the economy.
This project aims to analyze U.S. natural disaster declarations to identify trends, high-risk regions, frequently occurring disaster types, and yearly patterns using interactive data visualizations.
## 2. Dataset Description :
The dataset contains historical records of U.S. natural disaster declarations, including:
 - Disaster type (flood, hurricane, wildfire, etc.)
 - State and region
 - Declaration date
 - Incident begin and end dates
 - Year and month of occurrence
 - The data is sourced from publicly available U.S. government disaster records.
## 3. KPIs Used :
 - Total number of disaster declarations
 - State-wise disaster count
 - Most frequent disaster types
 - Year-wise and month-wise disaster trends
 - Top high-risk states
 - Disaster frequency growth over time
## 4. Dashboard Pages :
 - Overview Dashboard: Total disasters, trends, and KPIs
 - State-wise Analysis: Disaster distribution across U.S. states
 - Disaster Type Analysis: Frequency of different disaster types
 - Time-based Trends: Yearly and monthly disaster patterns
## 5. Key Insights :
 - Certain states experience significantly higher disaster declaratons
 - Floods, storms, and hurricanes are the most common disaster types
 - Disaster declarations show an increasing trend over recent years
 - Seasonal patterns are visible in disaster occurrences
## 6. Recommendations :
 - Focus disaster preparedness efforts on high-risk states
 - Improve early warning systems during peak disaster months
 - Allocate resources based on historical disaster frequency
 - Use predictive analytics for future disaster planning
## 7. Tools Used :
 - Power BI – Data visualization & dashboard creation
 - Excel / CSV – Data storage
 - Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
 - GitHub – Version control and project documentation
