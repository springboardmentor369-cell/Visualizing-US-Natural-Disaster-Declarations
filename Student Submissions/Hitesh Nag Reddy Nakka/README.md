# Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations: Trends and Patterns

## Problem Statement
Natural disasters significantly impact lives, infrastructure, and economies. The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize US natural disaster declaration data to identify trends, frequently affected regions, and commonly occurring disaster types. The insights derived can support better disaster preparedness and planning.

## Data and Description
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) website. It contains records of natural disaster declarations in the United States, including information such as disaster type, affected state and declaration date. The raw dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power BI for effective visualization.
### Data Modeling
- Implemented a Star Schema model  
- Created Fact and Dimension tables  
- Established relationships between tables  
- Created calculated columns and DAX measures  
- Optimized model for performance  

## KPI Used
The following KPIs were developed for analysis:
- Total Disaster Declarations  
- Total Public Assistance (PA) Declarations  
- Total Individual Assistance (IA) Declarations  
- Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Rate  
- Top Affected States  
- Most Frequent Disaster Type
These KPIs provide insights into disaster frequency, distribution, and long-term trends.

## Dashboard Pages
### State-wise Disaster Analysis
This dashboard focuses on geographic and state-level impact.
Features include:
- Map visualization of disaster declarations by state  
- State ranking by total declarations  
- Public Assistance and Individual Assistance distribution  
- Year-wise trend analysis  

---
### Disaster Type Analysis
This dashboard analyzes the distribution and trends of disaster categories.
Features include:
- Public vs Individual Assistance distribution 
- Top disaster types receiving Public Assistance
- Contribution of each disaster type 
- Comparative analysis between disaster categories  
---
## Key Insights
- Certain states experience a higher number of disaster declarations compared to others.
- Floods, storms, fires, and hurricanes are among the most frequently declared disaster types.
- A trend in disaster declarations is observed over the years.
  
## Recommendations
- Enhance disaster preparedness and response strategies in highly affected states.
- Allocate resources based on historical disaster trends.

## Tools Used
- Power BI (Data cleaning and visualization)
- Vs Code
- Jupyter Notebook (Exploratory Data Analysis using Python)
