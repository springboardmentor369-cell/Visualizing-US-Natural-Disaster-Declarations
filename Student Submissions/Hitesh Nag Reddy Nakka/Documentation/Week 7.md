# **Dashboard Creation Plan (Week 7: Visualization)**

These guidelines are based on discussions from the previous days to ensure optimal, clear, and effective data visualization.

# **General Principles**

* **Color Palette:** Use a focused color palette to avoid confusion and clearly convey meaning.  
  * Red: Alert/Caution  
  * Green: Positive/Profit  
  * Blue: Neutral  
* **Text and Titles:** All visuals and dashboards must include a clear, descriptive title.  
* **Interactivity:** Visuals should be connected, allowing one to filter or highlight data in another for an integrated experience.

# **Chart-Specific Rules**

## **Pie Charts**

* Limit pie charts to a maximum of **6 entities**. If you have more, consider grouping smaller segments into an "Other" category or using a different chart type.

## **Line Charts**

* Line charts are a mandatory component of the dashboard, as they are essential for showing trends over time.

# **Dashboard Design**

## **KPI Cards**

* Dashboards must start with **2 or 3 Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards**. These are the first elements users should review.  
* The two main KPI cards should represent different metrics.

## **Layout and Flow**

* Divide the entire canvas into distinct areas (e.g., four quadrants) for structured placement of visuals.  
* A **slicer** is a key element and must be included for interactive filtering of the data.

## **Visual Interpretation**

* Every visualization must be accompanied by a clear visual interpretation or caption explaining what the data shows and what the user should take away from it.
